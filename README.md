# 100-days-Challenge-PYTHON
Welcome to my 100 Days of Python journey!

Over the next 100 days, I am committed to consistently learning, practicing, and building projects in Python — one day at a time. This challenge is all about growing my skills, pushing my limits, and documenting my progress publicly.

🚀 Goals
Strengthen my core Python knowledge.

Build real-world, hands-on projects daily.

Explore topics like APIs, Web Development, Automation, Data Science, Machine Learning, and more.

Develop the habit of coding consistently.

Share my learning journey to inspire others.

📅 My Journey
Day 1: Completed a Mini Calculator 🧮

Day 2-100: (Coming soon... Stay tuned!)

Every day I will:

Learn something new.

Build a small project or mini app.

Commit my work to GitHub.

Reflect on what I learned.

🛠️ Tech Stack and Tools
Python 3

Git & GitHub

APIs

Flask, Django (later phases)

Tkinter (for GUIs)

Pandas, Matplotlib (for Data Visualization)

and more as the journey progresses!

✨ Why I’m Doing This
Consistency beats intensity.
By committing to small, meaningful progress every day, I aim to become a stronger developer and problem solver.
This journey is not about perfection — it's about perseverance, growth, and passion for coding. 💻✨

"A little progress each day adds up to big results."
