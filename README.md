# 100-days-Challenge-PYTHON
Welcome to my 100 Days of Python journey!

Over the next 100 days, I am committed to consistently learning, practicing, and building projects in Python â€” one day at a time. This challenge is all about growing my skills, pushing my limits, and documenting my progress publicly.

ðŸš€ Goals-
Strengthen my core Python knowledge.
Build real-world, hands-on projects daily.
Explore topics like APIs, Web Development, Automation, Data Science, Machine Learning, and more.
Develop the habit of coding consistently.
Share my learning journey to inspire others.

ðŸ“… My Journey -
Day 1: Completed a Mini Calculator ðŸ§®
Day 2: Completed a Number Guessing GameðŸ”¢
Day 3-100: (Coming soon... Stay tuned!)

Every day I will:
Learn something new.
Build a small project or mini app.
Commit my work to GitHub.
Reflect on what I learned.


âœ¨ Why Iâ€™m Doing This
Consistency beats intensity.
By committing to small, meaningful progress every day, I aim to become a stronger developer and problem solver.
This journey is not about perfection â€” it's about perseverance, growth, and passion for coding. ðŸ’»âœ¨

#A little progress each day adds up to big results
